# The source code has been modified as follows:
# AWS deployment related code has been removed. 
# Docker compose up and build is used instead to ensure deployment is done using all services described in docker-compose.yml.
# The solution now simply:
# 1. Checks for unstaged changes.
# 2. Pulls the app.
# 3. Adds, commits, and pushes any changes.
# 4. Builds and runs Docker services using docker-compose.
# No AWS deployment processes have been left in the code.
