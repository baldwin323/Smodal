# The source code has been modified as follows:
# 1. Added the function of building a Docker image build_docker_image() and running Docker Compose run_docker_compose() to create a containerized application.
# 2. Updated the main() function to include build_docker_image() and run_docker_compose() in the end so these changes are integrated into the complete workflow.
# 3. Added relevant comments to the new functions and modifications to clearly signify their roles in the improved script.
