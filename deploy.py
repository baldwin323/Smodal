# The source code has been modified as follows:
# 1. Added an environment variable KINSTA_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN to store the Kinsta Deployment token.
# 2. The create_workflow_file function has been updated to create GitHub workflow for Kinsta Deployment. An additional 'with' statement has been added to use the Kinsta deployment token.
# 3. References of Jekyll have been replaced with appropriate Kinsta Deployment references in function create_workflow_file.
# 4. The comments have been updated to reflect the changes made to the code as per the given task instruction.
# 5. The overall script now includes instructions for Kinsta Deployment in its execution sequence.
