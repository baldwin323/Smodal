<!-- This is the modified deploy.py script, filling the function of containerizing the app using Docker, installing necessary dependencies like the Elastic Beanstalk CLI, creating Dockerrun.aws.json with the necessary configuration, and deploying the app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Docker is installed via a simple curl command, and the Elastic Beanstalk CLI is installed via pip as per AWS's instructions. An environment is initialized via 'eb init', which will prompt the user to configure the environment. A Dockerrun.aws.json file is created, and its content is written directly within the script. Finally, the application is deployed using the 'eb deploy' command. -->
