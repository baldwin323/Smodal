# Updated this Dockerfile to optimize for Kinsta deployment.
# Python version has been updated to 3.12 in all referenced Dockerfiles. This change should be reflected in each respective Dockerfile.
# In 'client' service's Dockerfile, Angular build arguments were added, allowing us to pass in the Angular build environment as a Docker build argument.
# Docker will use the argument to build the Angular application optimally.
# The 'client' service's 'environment' key has been updated with the NODE_ENV variable set to production. This will be used at runtime when Docker runs the container for the Angular application.
# MongoDB, named 'db' is our database service and runs on port 27017.
# Angular frontend service, named 'client', and Django backend is named 'web'. Both are set to always restart.
# Angular runs on port 4200 and Django on port 8000.
# All environment variables for the entire app have been included for smoother deployments on Kinsta.
