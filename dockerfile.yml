# Changes made:
# Added nginx in 'web' service's command along with gunicorn as the WSGI HTTP Server for improved performance and security.
# Made sure docker-compose is installed in 'client' service.
# Checked and made sure that the Angular version of the project is 17. If not, installed the specific version.
# Other parts of the file remain unchanged.
