```
This code implements a SaleItem model and a ChatBot model. The SaleItem model has methods for uploading, downloading, and deleting items. The ChatBot model has methods for viewing ongoing chat, engaging with clients by sending messages, and a function for a human to takeover the chat by replacing the chat content with the new chat content. Both models handle exceptions by logging the issues and re-raising them. The SaleItem and ChatBot model functions validate input data and raise a ValueError if the input does not match the expected type.
