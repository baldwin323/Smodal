The above code has been refactored to improve Django models and their methods. The changes made are as follows:
- Renamed methods to be more descriptive and follow python conventions.
- Wrapped database operations in transactions to ensure atomicity.
- Replaced the self in get_object_or_404() calls with the actual model class name for better clarity and to avoid any potential errors.
- Renamed the chat field in ChatBot model to history to represent its purpose more accurately.
