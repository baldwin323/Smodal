# Note: The implementation of XMLTestRunner class and TEST_RUNNER might be project specific and might require additional packages like xmlrunner. The above code is a general approach and can be modified according to the specific requirements of the project.
# Note: You would need to pass XML_REPORTS_DIRECTORY as an environment variable where you want to generate XML reports.
