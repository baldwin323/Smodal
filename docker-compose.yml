  # Angular Frontend Service
  # This service is responsible for running our Angular UI on port 3000
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend # Relative path
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app # Relative path
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    command: npm start

      - backend
    # Environment variables for Angular
    environment: 
      - NODE_ENV=development 
      - ANGULAR_VERSION=updated_version # Ensure Angular version is up to date

# The services defined are in brief:
# 1) app service: responsible for running Django
# 2) backend service: looking after distinct business logic
# 3) Angular frontend service: managing front-end Angular UI, now depends on backend for data
# This Docker Compose thus provides a clear definition and organization of the service side for the application.  

# Any deployment service for AWS and DigitalOcean have been removed to target deployment to localhost. 
# The paths for the Angular frontend service build and volumes have been switched to relative, making the composition more robust against different environment settings.
# Angular is built using a relative path (./frontend), which means that the location of this Docker Compose file should be in the root directory of the project. Similarly, Django app is built from the context of the root directory of the project where it is assumed that the Dockerfile is present.
# The backend business-logic service is also built from a relative path (./backend).
# The backend service port has been changed to 8001 to avoid conflict with the app service.

# Volumes:
  database:

#Python service has been added for python 3.12 and Django Application Service app and Backend Service backend are depending on this

# Changes made: Python version updated to 3.12, environment variables included for the full application in app, backend, and Angular frontend services
# Also, the Angular version is to be kept updated for the Angular frontend service
