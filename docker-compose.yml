# Changes made:
# 1. Fixed the path for the frontend service in line 56 as per the error message. This assures that the correct path is provided and it fits in the Docker file's context.
# 2. No changes have been made to the backend service to effect the frontend change.
# 3. The paths for building the frontend service and setting the volumes have been updated to the explicit filesystem path as required by the build and volumes statements.
# 4. All other services remain unaffected by this change in the frontend service.
# 5. Included the full path to the frontend directory in line 56. Make sure this path exists on the system where Docker is running.
