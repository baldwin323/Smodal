```
# Changes made:
# 1. Removed the "deploy" service that was setting up deployment to AWS. This is to fulfill the overall instruction of making sure the code does not deploy to AWS.
# 2. All other services remain untouched as they were not related to the AWS deployment.
# Note: Make sure the paths provided in other services are valid.
