  # This involves running our Django Application on port 8000

  # Backend Service
  # This service is responsible for handling separate business logic, if any present
  # This service also operates on port 8000
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

  # Frontend Service
  # This service is responsible for running our front-end GUI on port 3000
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend # Relative path
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app # Relative path
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    command: npm start


# The deployment service for AWS has been removed to prevent deployment to AWS.
# The paths for the frontend service build and volumes have been switched to relative, making the composition more robust against different environment settings.
# All existing services remain untouched as they were not associated with AWS deployment.
# Ensure that the path provided in other services is accurate and accessible.

```
# Note: Ensure the offered repositories in relative paths actually exist.
# The services defined are in brief:
# 1) app service: responsible for running Django
# 2) backend service: looking after distinct business logic
# 3) frontend service: managing front-end GUI
# This Docker Compose thus provides a clear definition and organization of the service side for the application.
