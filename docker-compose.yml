# Volumes and further comments are unchanged
# The services defined are in brief:
# 1) app service: responsible for running Django
# 2) backend service: looking after distinct business logic
# 3) Angular frontend service: managing front-end Angular UI, now depends on backend for data
# This Docker Compose thus provides a clear definition and organization of the service side for the application.  

# Any deployment service for AWS and DigitalOcean have been removed to target deployment to localhost. 
# The paths for the Angular frontend service build and volumes have been switched to relative, making the composition more robust against different environment settings. 
# Angular is built using a relative path (./frontend), which means that the location of this Docker Compose file should be in the root directory of the project. Similarly, Django app is built from the context of the root directory of the project where it is assumed that the Dockerfile is present.
# The backend business-logic service is also built from a relative path (./backend).
# The backend service port has been changed to 8001 to avoid conflict with the app service.
