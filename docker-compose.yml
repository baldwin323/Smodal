# Changes made:
# 1. Added docker compose services for app, backend, frontend and deploy
# 2. The app service for Django has been added, it builds the Dockerfile included in the context, volumes are mounted and the server is started once the instance is up. Port 8000 is exposed for access.
# 3. The backend service is included, even if separated, depending on the architecture. It should depend on the app to ensure the sequence of server start-ups.
# 4. The frontend service is included to run the GUI part of the project, which starts the npm server.
# 5. Deploy service has been added to handle AWS deployments, AWS credentials should be passed through environment variables.
# 6. Finally, a database volume is included for persistent data.
