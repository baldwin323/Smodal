# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It is architectured based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, separation of concerns, Django's templacing system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. Now, it also boasts integration with Pactflow and SwaggerHub to further enhance the application's robustness and versatility.

To set up the latest, highly optimized version of the Django app, you need to set up a Python virtual environment first. Follow these steps:

### Setting up a virtual environment

On Windows:
```
python -m venv env
```
On Unix/MacOS:
```
python3 -m venv env
```
Activate the environment:

On Windows:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
On Unix/MacOS:
```
source env/bin/activate
```
### Installing Dependencies

Once in the virtual environment, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file to install all the necessary dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to start the application:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Here is a glimpse into our application's prime features:

1. **Exception Handling**: We utilize Django's try/except blocks to systematically process exceptions and log them for future debugging.

2. **Data Validation**: We enforce stringent validation checks for user-submitted data, thereby ensuring data integrity and reducing error possibilities.

3. **Testing**: Emphasising on the delivery of quality code, we have designed extensive unit and integration tests ensuring application's flawless functioning.

4. **Documentation**: Alongside efficient code, we provide comprehensive documentation including thorough docstrings and README files, simplifying the maintenance process.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: Complying with Django's best practices, we have distinct files for templates, views, forms, and models ensuring code readability and clean organization.

6. **Templating**: We leverage Django's templating system, using template tags, variables, includes, etc., over basic HTML, thereby streamlining the development process.

7. **Security**: To ensure top-notch security, our app employs input sanitization, password hashing, and access restrictions on unauthorized users, safeguarding user information at every cost.

8. **Custom Error Pages**: We extend a positive user experience even in the event of a glitch by showcasing custom 404 and 500 error pages.

9. **Caching**: Our application makes use of caching for operations involving high resource usage, thereby ensuring optimal performance.

10. **Logging**: A comprehensive logging feature is integrated with our application, aiding us in real-time performance monitoring and early identification of potential issues.

11. **Modularity**: By segregating functionalities into reusable apps/modules, we abide by the DRY principles, thereby boosting code maintainability for future enhancements.

12. **Integration with Pactflow and SwaggerHub**: We have integrated Pactflow for managing, sharing, testing and verifying APIs contracts and SwaggerHub for designing, building, documenting and consuming RESTful APIs. This enhances collaboration and coordination between development and operation teams, leading to more efficient application development and maintenance process.
