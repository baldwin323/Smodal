# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based chatbot application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It has an intuitive onboarding flow to guide new users. The application is architected based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, progress tracking, separation of concerns, Django's templating system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. It now comes wrapped in a docker container which makes it easy to set up and use.

The UI of the application is intentionally designed with proper theming and responsiveness in mind. It adapts properly to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly. It features loading spinners to indicate processing requests. The application also prompts for user feedback periodically to continuously refine its capabilities.

It only requires internet connection and a browser to function effectively, and can be powered on with a single click similar to a web or mobile app.
