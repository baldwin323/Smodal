# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It is architectured based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, separation of concerns, Django's templacing system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. Now, it also boasts integration with Pactflow and SwaggerHub to further enhance the application's robustness and versatility.

To set up the latest, highly optimized version of the Django app on a DigitalOcean droplet, follow these steps:

### Setting up a DigitalOcean Droplet

First, navigate to the DigitalOcean dashboard. Click `Create` then `Droplets`.

Choose the following configurations for your new droplet:

* Image: Choose Ubuntu
* Plan: Choose Basic, and select a plan that suits your requirements.
* Region: Choose the region that is closest to your users.
* Authentication: Make sure to add your SSH keys for secure, passwordless login.

Create the droplet, and note down the IP address. You will use this IP address to access your droplet.

SSH into your new droplet:

```
ssh root@Your-Droplet-IP-Address
```

### Setting up a virtual environment

On your new droplet:

```
python3 -m venv /path/to/project/venv
```

Activate the environment:

```
source /path/to/project/venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once in the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies:

```
pip install django
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone your Django app repository and navigate into it:

```
git clone Your-Repository-URL
cd Your-Repository-Directory
```

### Set Up Django App

Prepare the Django application:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Set the environment variables necessary for the application to run. For example:

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=Your-Settings
```

Collect the static files:

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Now you are ready to start the application:

```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
exit
```

Make sure that the `DEBUG` setting is set to `False` in the `settings.py` file for production deployment. Configure the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASES`, and `STATIC_ROOT` settings accordingly.

## Build Commands

The following commands will help you to build the application:

```
./manage.py buildcommands
```

This command will gather and execute the necessary build commands for your application.

## Deployment on DigitalOcean

After adjustments in the settings.py file, you're ready to deploy the Django application on a DigitalOcean droplet. Execute the following command:

```
source /path/to/project/venv/bin/activate
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 project.wsgi
exit
```

This will start Gunicorn, which serves as the application server, and binds the application to your IP address on port 8000. Access your application by visiting `http://Your-Droplet-IP-Address:8000` in the web browser.

Now, your Django app should be up and running on your DigitalOcean droplet at Your-Droplet-IP-Address:8000.

### Deploying with Helm and Kubernetes

Firstly, ensure that Helm and Kubernetes are properly installed in your system. Follow these steps to deploy your application using Helm and Kubernetes:

1. Build your Docker image and push it to your Docker repository.

   ```
   docker build -t sobereyed/modal.tokai:tagname .
   docker push sobereyed/modal.tokai:tagname
   ```

2. Navigate to the Helm directory of our project.

   ```
   cd /Smodal/helm
   ```

3. Deploy the Helm chart.

   ```
   helm install modal-tokai ./ -f values.yaml
   ```

This will deploy the Django application on the Kubernetes cluster.

## Testing

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the application, testing is performed at various levels:

```
source /path/to/project/venv/bin/activate
python manage.py test
exit
```

This provides comprehensive test coverage, including testing of the DigitalOcean API integration and the deployment-related settings.
