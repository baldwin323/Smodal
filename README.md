# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based chatbot application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It has an intuitive onboarding flow to guide new users. The application is architected based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, progress tracking, separation of concerns, Django's templacing system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. It now also features Dockerization for containerization and easy deployment across all systems.

The UI of the application is intentionally designed with proper theming and responsiveness in mind. It adapts properly to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly. It features loading spinners to indicate processing requests. The application also prompts for user feedback periodically to continuously refine its capabilities.

## Getting Started

To start using this application, you'll first need to set up your Docker environment, then you'll build the Docker image and deploy the Docker container.

### Setting Up Docker Environment
To install Docker on your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Building Docker Image
Once you have Docker installed, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and build the Docker image using the following command:
```bash
docker build -t modal.tokai .
```

### Docker Deployment
After the Docker image has been built, you can deploy the container using the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:80 -d modal.tokai
```

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment
To deploy the Docker container to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, refer to the deploy.py script in the repository.

## Connecting from Anywhere
After deploying your application, there are several options to connect to it from anywhere:

### SSH Tunnel
An SSH Tunnel can be set up to securely forward a local port to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, allowing you to connect using localhost.

### Public IP
You can expose a public IP for your Elastic Beanstalk environment and connect directly to that IP. This option is less secure but easier to set up.

### Elastic IP
An Elastic IP can be assigned to your Elastic Beanstalk environment for connectivity. The IP will remain static.

Do keep in mind to ensure the correct ports are exposed in the Docker/docker-compose configuration and that the security groups in AWS have been configured to allow inbound connections on those ports. The ports should also be mapped correctly to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Further frontend connections might require setting up environment variables with the correct backend URL, which can either be a public URL or an internal DNS name for Elastic Beanstalk.
