# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It is architectured based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, separation of concerns, Django's templacing system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. Now, it also boasts integration with Pactflow and SwaggerHub to further enhance the application's robustness and versatility.

To set up the latest, highly optimized version of the Django app on a DigitalOcean droplet, follow these steps:

### Setting up a DigitalOcean Droplet

First, navigate to the DigitalOcean dashboard. Click `Create` then `Droplets`.

Choose the following configurations for your new droplet:

* Image: Choose Ubuntu
* Plan: Choose Basic, and select a plan that suits your requirements.
* Region: Choose the region that is closest to your users.
* Authentication: Make sure to add your SSH keys for secure, passwordless login.

Create the droplet, and note down the IP address. You will use this IP address to access your droplet.

SSH into your new droplet:

```
ssh root@Your-Droplet-IP-Address
```

### Setting up a virtual environment

On your new droplet:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once in the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone your Django app repository and navigate into it:

```
git clone Your-Repository-URL
cd Your-Repository-Directory
```

### Set Up Django App

Set up the Django application:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

Set the environment variables necessary for the application to run. For example:

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=Your-Settings
```

Now you are ready to start the application:

```
python manage.py runserver 0:8000
```

Collect the static files:

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

Make sure that the `DEBUG` setting is set to `False` in the `settings.py` file for production deployment. Configure the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASES`, and `STATIC_ROOT` settings accordingly.

## Deployment on DigitalOcean

After adjustments in the settings.py file, you're ready to deploy the Django application on a DigitalOcean droplet. Execute the following command:

```
gunicorn django_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

This will start Gunicorn, which serves as the application server and binds the application to your IP address on port 8000. Access your application by visiting `http://Your-Droplet-IP-Address:8000` in the web browser.

Now, your Django app should be up and running on your DigitalOcean droplet at Your-Droplet-IP-Address:8000.

## Testing

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the application, testing is performed at various levels:

```
pytest tests.py
```

This provides comprehensive test coverage, including testing of the DigitalOcean API integration and the deployment-related settings.
