## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It is architectured based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, separation of concerns, Django's templacing system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. Now, it also boasts integration with Pactflow and SwaggerHub to further enhance the application's robustness and versatility.

## Getting Started

To begin, you need to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. More detailed instructions for this process can be found in the DigitalOcean Control Panel.

### AWS Lambda Deployment
For an AWS Lambda Deployment, the following steps must be executed:
1. **Create an AWS Lambda Function**: This can be done through the AWS Console or the AWS CLI/SDK. Define the properties such as: Name, Role (for permissions), Runtime (e.g. Python), Handler (the entry point function), Timeout, and Memory Allocation.
2. **Write the AWS Lambda Function Code**: This involves creating a .py file containing the handler function and its dependencies. A framework like Chalice or Zappa could be used to generate the Lambda deployment package.
3. **Package the Code into a Deployment Package**: This usually takes the form of a .zip file containing the .py file and dependencies. Alternatively, a layer with dependencies can be used or a container image can be created.
4. **Upload the Deployment Package to AWS Lambda**: The deployment package needs to be uploaded to AWS Lambda. This can be done in the AWS Console by uploading the .zip file, using the AWS CLI/SDK, or as a part of a CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Configure Any Triggers for the Lambda Function**: Possible triggers include an S3 bucket for file uploads, API Gateway for API endpoints, Event Bridge for events, or Scheduled events.
6. **Test the Lambda Function**: Testing can be done by invoking the function from the AWS Console, using the Lambda Test Event feature, or sending requests to any of the configured triggers.
7. **Monitor and Configure Logging/Metrics for the Lambda Function**: This is crucial for troubleshooting and performance optimization. Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging to identify issues or improvements.

### Optimization tip: Lambda Cold Start
To mitigate Lambda Cold Start, keep your functions warm by invoking them at least once every 5 to 25 minutes.

## Executing Build Commands

The build process can be optimized through parallel execution and caching. Utilize the make utility for tasks that can be run concurrently, and use caching to avoid re-downloading or re-compiling assets.
