# Python Flask modal.tokai

## Description

**Name**: modal.tokai Django Application

**Description**: The modal.tokai application is a state-of-the-art Django-based chatbot application delivering robust functionality and convenience to its users. It has an intuitive onboarding flow to guide new users. The application is architected based on sound software engineering principles including proper exception handling, data validation, rigorous testing, thorough documentation, progress tracking, separation of concerns, Django's templating system, stringent security measures, custom error pages, caching, exhaustive logging system, and modularity. It now also features Dockerization for containerization and easy deployment across all systems.

The UI of the application is intentionally designed with proper theming and responsiveness in mind. It adapts properly to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly. It features loading spinners to indicate processing requests. The application also prompts for user feedback periodically to continuously refine its capabilities.

## Getting Started

The application now supports deployment using Docker Compose. This guide walks you through the process of deploying the application using Docker Compose.

To start using this application, first, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, refer to the Docker installation guide provided here. 

### Installing Docker & Docker Compose
To install Docker on your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```
To install Docker Compose, ensure you have Docker installed then follow the instructions at this link: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Deploying with Docker Compose
With Docker and Docker Compose installed, navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file. Deploy the application using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

No need to build images or run containers manually, Docker Compose takes care of that.

## Connecting from Anywhere
After deploying your application, there are several options to connect to it from anywhere:

### SSH Tunnel
An SSH Tunnel can be set up to securely forward a local port to your Docker container, allowing you to connect using localhost.

### Public IP
You can expose a public IP for your Docker container and connect directly to that IP. This option is less secure but easier to set up.

### Elastic IP
An Elastic IP can be assigned to your Docker container for connectivity. The IP will remain static.

Do keep in mind to ensure the correct ports are exposed in the Docker/docker-compose configuration. Also, map the ports correctly if you're using a cloud service.
