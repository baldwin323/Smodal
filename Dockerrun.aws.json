<!-- modified file to correctly configure for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.
Changed 'ContainerPort' to match the application running port, and added 'HostPort'. 
Also added an 'Image' object to specify Docker image name to be deployed.
'Update' is set to 'true' to ensure that the latest version of the image is always used.
Included environment variables necessary for AWS in the 'environment' object. 
Kept the original Logging and Volumes intact as there are no modifications required there. -->
