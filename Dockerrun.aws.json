<!-- Further modification details- Correctly configured Dockerrun.aws.json for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.
Updated 'ContainerPort' to match the application's running port, and added 'HostPort'. Also included the correct backend URL in environment variables.
Kept the 'Update' as 'true' to ensure that the latest version of the image is always used.
Left the 'Logging' and 'Volumes' as are, since they require no modifications. -->
