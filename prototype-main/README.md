# AI Chat Bot Cloning Application

This application is designed with influencers and entertainers in mind, aiming to create an AI chat bot, a perfect digital clone, that can enhance your interactions with your growing audience and help maintain a perfect public image as per your needs.

Introducing "modal.tokai", a powerful AI assistant that guides you step by step through creating and refining the clone. It leverages the power of OpenAI APIs, resulting in a more accurate, engaging digital representation.

With modal.tokai, you can:
- Enhance the user experience in your web and social media chats
- Boost your digital and merchandise sales
- Tailor the digital clone to mirror your personality or desired image

The aim is not just to create a replica of yourself, but to craft a tool that increases your digital reach and optimizes revenue from digital/merch sales, engagement, and communication with your followers.

## Getting Started

Begin your journey of creating your own digital clone with these simple steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local system
2. Navigate to the directory of the downloaded project in your command prompt or terminal with `cd modal.tokai/prototype-main`
3. Securely add your OpenAI API key in the application's back-end by replacing `openai_api_key = PLACE_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE`
4. Install the required packages by running `npm install` (Ensure Node.js is installed on your system)
5. Once the packages are installed, run `npm start` to initialize the cloning process. The application uses your OpenAI API key to make a call to OpenAI backend.
6. Logged in or not, OpenAI API will initiate the process of creating your personalized clone, guided by modal.tokai suggestions and your input. This AI learning period is an important phase - your active participation enhances the accuracy of the final model.
7. Once the learning phase is complete and your clone is ready, you'll find a checkbox to activate it. Once checked, your clone will be the one greeting you with the name you've assigned. This functionality is persistently active as long as the checkbox is marked.

Feel free to explore and test the application. Your feedback and suggestions are crucial to us in our goal to continually improve modal.tokai's performance and abilities.
